## Goal

The goal of the code examples is to create a service or functionality that can determine whether a customer may be eligible for a loan based on the amount of the requested loan, the purpose of the loan, and customer information. This is done through checking credit ratings, verifying against blacklisting, and evaluating conditions.

## Functions

### Verify Customer Registration

- Checks whether the customer is already registered in the system.
- Determines if the customer needs to provide additional information.

### Perform Customer Registration

- Conducts customer registration when necessary.
- Inserts customer data into the database if required.

### Check for Blacklisting

- Determines whether the customer is blacklisted and prevents loan issuance in such cases.

### Collect Credit Ratings

- Retrieves both the internal and external credit ratings of the customer if available.

### Check Conditions

- Verifies if the conditions for loan approval are met, including the loan amount in relation to the customer's creditworthiness.
