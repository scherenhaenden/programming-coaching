### User Specification

#### Interface: IUserExternalService

**Description**: The `IUserExternalService` interface defines a contract for retrieving credit rating user external information based on a national identification ID.

**Use Case**: This interface is used to fetch credit rating user external information, which can be useful for various financial and user profile-related operations in the application.

**User Story**:
- As a financial analyst, I need to access external credit rating information for users identified by their national identification ID to make informed decisions regarding financial transactions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The `IUserExternalService` interface must define a method named `GetCreditRatingUserExternals` that takes a `nationalIdentificationId` parameter and returns a nullable `CreditRatingUserExternalModel`.
- The method should return `null` if no matching user external information is found for the provided `nationalIdentificationId`.
- Implementing classes must adhere to this interface and provide a concrete implementation for retrieving user external information.

### Technical Specification

#### Class: UserExternalService

**Description**: The `UserExternalService` class implements the `IUserExternalService` interface and provides functionality for fetching credit rating user external information from a data source.

**Class Members**:
- **Constructor**: `UserExternalService(IDataCredit db)`
    - **Description**: Initializes an instance of the `UserExternalService` class with a data credit repository.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `db` (Type: `IDataCredit`): The data credit repository used for data retrieval.
    - **Usage**:
        - This constructor allows the `UserExternalService` class to be instantiated with a specific data repository.

- **Method**: `GetCreditRatingUserExternals`
    - **Description**: Retrieves credit rating user external information based on a national identification ID.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `nationalIdentificationId` (Type: `string`): The national identification ID used to identify the user.
    - **Returns**:
        - Type: `CreditRatingUserExternalModel?`
        - A nullable `CreditRatingUserExternalModel` representing the user's external credit rating information, or `null` if no matching information is found.
    - **Behavior**:
        - The method uses the provided data credit repository (`db`) to query for user external information.
        - If a matching user external record is found in the repository for the given `nationalIdentificationId`, it is returned; otherwise, `null` is returned.
    - **Usage**:
        - This method is used throughout the application to fetch credit rating user external data for financial analysis and user profile management.

**Constructor Injection**: The `UserExternalService` class follows constructor injection to receive its data credit repository (`IDataCredit`), promoting dependency injection and separation of concerns.

**Error Handling**: The class handles potential null values gracefully using the null-conditional operator (`?.`) when accessing properties or methods of the data credit repository (`db`).

**Usage**: The `UserExternalService` class is designed to be used for retrieving credit rating user external information when needed in various parts of the application, such as financial analysis and user profile management.

**Testing**: The class should be thoroughly unit-tested, including scenarios where the data credit repository returns null or non-null results. Mocking or providing test data for the data credit repository (`db`) is advisable during testing.
