things found a lot the way

- I have to debug more
- I have to think a lot more about the tests to be able to represent everything I would need
- Once I found some error, I need to rethink if what I sending to the method is correct or the method has an error
for longer time
- If I find an error, it takes way to long, find out because of the whole debugging procees till I found where is the position
and till I understand what data im using at that poing and what data I should use
