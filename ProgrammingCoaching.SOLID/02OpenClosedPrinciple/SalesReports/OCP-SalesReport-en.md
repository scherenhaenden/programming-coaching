## Code Demonstration: Evolution and Complexity

### Overview
The provided code examples demonstrate how a class, `ReportExampleBad`, evolves over time to accommodate new requirements, leading to increased complexity in its methods, particularly `GetReport`. This evolution exemplifies a violation of the Open/Closed Principle, a crucial concept in the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

### Progression Analysis
- **Initial Stage**: The `ReportExampleBad` class starts with a straightforward method that handles a single report type.
- **Intermediate Stage**: As new requirements emerge, the method expands to include multiple report types, managed through a series of `if-else` statements.
- **Advanced Stage**: The class becomes increasingly complex, making it challenging to manage and extend.

### Testing Evolution
Accompanying test classes, `ReportExample1BadTest`, `ReportExample2BadTest`, and `ReportExample3BadTest`, demonstrate the parallel evolution of testing approaches in response to the class's development.

- **Notable Observation**: In `ReportExample3BadTest`, the iterative approach over various report types highlights the method's growing unwieldiness.

### Educational Implications
These code examples serve as a cautionary illustration of the pitfalls of not adhering to the Open/Closed Principle:
- Adding new conditional branches for each report type significantly complicates modification and extension efforts.
- This approach contradicts the principle's goal of enabling class extensions without altering existing functionality.

### Recommended Approach
In real-world applications, a more effective strategy would involve polymorphism:
- Different report types should be managed by unique subclasses.
- These subclasses would extend a common base class or implement a common interface.
- This strategy aligns with the Open/Closed Principle, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability of the codebase.
